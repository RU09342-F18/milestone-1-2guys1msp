# Milestone 1

Within this Milestone, the goal was to be able to link up many of these boards to be able to commmunicate with other boards utilizing UART commands to change LED lights. Transmitting data across UART from board to board using HEX allows the board to recieve commands to control each color of the RGB LED's brightness by changing the duty cycle of each LED. The faster the cycle, the stronger the LED. The entire string of bytes is to be sent along from board to board, each board taking 3 of the least significant bytes and then passing on the rest. To facilitate the passing on of the bits, a state machine is utilized with multiple states that is controlled by a variable called byte. It first saves the size of the packet it recieves as the first state. For the second state it sets a new value for the Red LED by accepting a new pulse width modulation from the recieved data. For the third state it does the same as the RED LED, but instead for the GREEN LED. For the fourth state, it does the same as the GREEN LED, but instead for the BLUE LED. RX input is able to be interrupted to proccess current bytes, and able to be resumed for a continuation of the stream.
